# gradient descent example

In this code, I've used the gradient descent technique from machine learning to estimate the line of best fit 
for the given dataset points. The data file corresponds to the downloads and uninstalls from an Android application.
At first, the system is started with a horizontal line (`y = m*x + b` with `m = 0` and `b = 0`). 
Through 600 steps, it gets pretty close to the actual line of best fit. 

Expected value: **m=0.688318621674364, b=0.704989689999731**

Obtained result: **m=0.71661290544,  b=0.055726280524**
